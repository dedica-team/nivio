Output
======

HTTP API
--------

The API offers three types of output:

* JSON under :file:`/api`
* rendered maps under :file:`/render`
* generated landscape documentation under :file:`/docs`
* search under :file:`/api/{landscape}/search/{lucene style query}`

Please see the swagger documentation under :file:`/v2/api-docs` (JSON) or :file:`/swagger-ui.html` (HTML GUI) for details.

Searching
---------

Nivio indexes all landscape items in an in-memory search engine called Lucene. You can build sophisticated queries on
various item fields (see :ref:`Model and Syntax`). For further information see https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html


Modifying Item Appearance
-------------------------


Icons by Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The icon of an item is determined by its item type (e.g. server, database, ...) and defaults to a cog () .

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    items:
      - identifier: bar
        type: database

As type values all items from https://materialdesignicons.com/ can be chosen. Just add the icon name without the "SVG" suffix,
like "account".

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    items:
      - identifier: bar
        type: account

The following types are translated icons to maintain backward compatibility:

* CACHE -> "flash-circle"
* CONTAINER -> "inbox"
* FIREWALL -> "wall"
* HUMANUSER -> "account"
* INTERFACE -> "connection"
* KEYVALUESTORE -> "keyvaluestore"
* LOADBALANCER -> "loadbalancer"
* MESSAGEQUEUE -> "tray-full"
* MOBILECLIENT -> "cellphone"
* VOLUME -> "harddisk"
* WEBSERVICE -> "application"

Vendor Logos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *icon* property can also work with a predefined vendor name, like "redis", prefixed with ``vendor://`` as scheme.

Vendor icons are work in progress.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    items:
      - identifier: bar
        icon: vendor://redis

To change the appearance of an item to a vendor logo the ``icon`` or ``fill`` properties can be set.
Both properties take a valid URL.

External Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To include external images in the map, just set the ``icon`` property (or :ref:`fill <Background fill>`) to a valid URL.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

   items:
      - identifier: foo
        icon: http://my.custom/icon.png


Background fill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While icon (see :ref:`External Images` above) is rendered as centered image on the node, fill is used to paint the entire
background and is more suitable to be used with images, photos, and so on.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

   items:
      - identifier: bar
        fill: http://my.custom/background.png

UTF-8 Symbols and shortname as Icons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If **NO** icon, type, or fill value is set, but a shortname value is given, the value is displayed on the icon. The first
example would display ``FOOBAR`` on the item and the second an enlarged unicorn symbol (shortnames less than three characters are
enlarged).

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

   items:
      - identifier: bar
        shortname: FOOBAR
      - identifier: pony
        shortname: ðŸ¦„


Custom(er) Branding
===================

The appearance of rendered maps can be altered to match corporate identities. When an SVG map is created, Nivio tries to
load and include custom CSS from a URL which can be configured in the landscape configuration. Furthermore, a logo can be
included. A logo is configured in the landscape config and must be a URL pointing to an includable file.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

   identifier: branded_landscape
   name: branded

   config:
     branding:
       mapStylesheet: https://acme.com/css/acme.css
       mapLogo: https://acme.com/images/logo.png

   items:
     ...

You can also apply custom colors to the user interface. Set the following environment variables to hex values (e.g. :samp:`#234234`):

* :envvar:`NIVIO_BRANDING_FOREGROUND` to set the primary color for interface elements
* :envvar:`NIVIO_BRANDING_BACKGROUND` for the background color (dark grey is default)
* :envvar:`NIVIO_BRANDING_SECONDARY` to set the accent color used for active elements

Graph Layout Tweaking
=====================

In rare cases the layout needs some manual improvements. Internally Nivio uses a forced directed layout, which can be
influenced by tweaking some parameters (although mxgraph is not used anymore, for further explanation see https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/java/docs/com/mxgraph/layout/mxFastOrganicLayout.html).

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    identifier: nivio:example
    name: Landscape example
    sources:
      - url: "./items/dashboard.yml"
        format: nivio

    # landscape configuration
    config:
      groupLayoutConfig:

        # the higher, the longer the edges between groups
        forceConstantFactor: 2.8

        # higher value is CPU intensive, but can lead to better layouts
        maxIterations: 1000

        # can also influence edge length and layout
        minDistanceLimitFactor: 3.05

        # multiplies the max distance limit
        maxDistanceLimitFactor: 2

      itemLayoutConfig:

        # the higher, the longer the edges between groups
        forceConstantFactor: 2.8

        # higher value is CPU intensive, but can lead to better layouts
        maxIterations: 1000

        # can also influence edge length and layout
        minDistanceLimitFactor: 3.05

        # multiplies the max distance limit
        maxDistanceLimitFactor: 2
