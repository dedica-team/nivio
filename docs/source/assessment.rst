Data Assessment using KPIs
==========================

KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) can be used to evaluate landscape components (typically items, but also groups) based on
their properties. The result is a status represented by colors (ordinal):

* UNKNOWN (order 0): status could not be determined
* GREEN (order 1): everything OK
* YELLOW (order 2): ignorable warning
* ORANGE (order 3): warning
* RED (order 4): error
* BROWN (order 5): fubar


Built in KPIs
-------------

* scaling (warning is the scale label is exactly 0)
* health (examines the health label on items)
* condition (K8s condition true/false evaluation)
* custom (see below)

Custom KPIs
-----------

Custom KPIs can be configured in the landscape config using ranges and/or matchers (regular expressions) and applied to everything having labels.
In the example below a KPI "monthlyCosts" is defined using ranges on the label "costs" and the KPI "myEval" evaluates a
label "foo". Both ranges (inclusive lower and upper limits) and matchers are separated by semicolon.
