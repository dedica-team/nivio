Model and Syntax
================


Landscape
---------

A landscape is defined as a collection of items which somehow belong together, be it for technical
or business reasons. For example, a company department might model ALL its applications in production as one landscape and use grouping
or tagging to further separate the applications. A second landscape could be used to model a future layout with a different
infrastructure. Both landscapes could have items in common (like a database, load balancer etc.), so their configuration can be reused.

A landscape can/must have the following attributes:

* **identifier**: a unique identifier. Use a name or an URN, validated against ^[a-z0-9\\.\\:_-]{3,256}$
* **name** human readable, displayed name
* **contact** e.g. an email
* **description** a short text describing the landscape

Landscape Items
---------------

An item represents anything that has a meaning in the landscape. It can be a server, a service, some hardware or a person.

A item should have the following attributes:

* **identifier**: a unique identifier in the landscape. Use a name or an URN, validated against ^[a-z0-9\\.\\:_-]{3,256}$
* **group** name of the group (optional). If a group is given it becomes part of the global identifier.Any item can only be part of one group.
* **name** human readable, displayed name
* **contact** support/notification contact (email) may be addressed in case of errors
* **description** a short description

Other fields:

* **links** a map/dictionary of urls to more information
* **lifecycle** life cycle phase. One of "planned", "integration", "production", "end of life" (abbrevs work)
* **statuses** status objects, represented in colors
    * label: stability, capability, health, security ....)
    * status: green, yellow, orange, red, brown
    * message: Everything ok.
* **interfaces** an array of provided interfaces or endpoints
    * description: description
    * format: media type or binary format
    * url: an url pointing to the interface
* **relations** connections to other items
    * type: provider (hard dependency) or data flow (soft dependency)
    * description: description
    * target: a item identifier
    * format: media type or binary format
* **providedBy** array of references to other items (identifiers)


Plus, there are labels having a special meaning:

.. include:: labels.rst


You can also store **custom properties** as labels, but keep in mind that

* label keys are converted to lowercase
* label values are stored as string

**Item configuration**

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    items:
      - identifier: blog-server
        shortName: blog1
        group: content
        mycustomlabel1: foo
        mycustomlabel_2: bar
        any: entry is stored as label

      - identifier: auth-gateway
        shortName: blog1
        layer: ingress
        group: content

      - identifier: DB1
        software: MariaDB
        version: 10.3.11
        type: database
        layer: infrastructure

Item Groups
-----------
Groups can have the following attributes:

* **identifier**: a unique identifier in the landscape. Provided automatically via the dictionary key, do not set it
* **contains** array of references to other items (identifiers and CQN queries)
* **owner** owning party (e.g. Marketing)
* **description** a short description
* **team** technical owner
* **contact** support/notification contact (email) may be addressed in case of errors
* **color** a hex color code for rendering
* **links** a map/dictionary of urls to more information

**Group configuration**

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    groups:
      content:
        description: All services responsible to provide information on the web.

Item Identification and Referencing
------------------------------------

A item can be uniquely identified by its landscape, its group and its identifier. A fully qualified
identifier is composed of these three: **mylandscape/agroup/theitem**. Since the group is optional, items with unique
identifier can also be addressed using **mylandscape/theitem** or just **theitem**. Nivio tries to resolve the correct item and raises
an error if it cannot be found or the result is ambiguous.

Service references are required to describe a provider relation or data flows.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:

    items:
      - identifier: theservice
        group: agroup
        relations:
          - target: anothergroup/anotherservice
            format: json
            type: dataflow
