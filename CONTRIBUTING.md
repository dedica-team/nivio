# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on [Slack](https://dedica-hacktoberfest.slack.com/). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Contributors](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/graphs/contributors) tells you where we are,
  * [Our project roadmap](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/projects/1)
  * [Issues](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/issues)
  * [Chat](https://dedica-hacktoberfest.slack.com/)
  * *Readme* - both frontend and backend contain readme files (see ./src/main/...)

## Testing

  * For the backend code we test using Jupiter and sometimes using SpringBootTest or WireMock. Use of AssertJ is encouraged.
  * The frontend is tested using Jest and React Testing library.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

  * The *develop* branch is the base for all new features.
  * Always write a clear log message for your commits.
  * Please include the ticket id in commit messages if possible.
  * Make sure that your contribution is well tested.
  * Try not to introduce new dependencies for common tasks

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We think that the Zen Of Python is a good idea and we hate code generation.
  * In Java we indent using four spaces (IntelliJ default settings)
  * In React we indent using two spaces using prettier.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code and make it look nice for them. 

Thanks,
the dedica team
