# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on Slack (tbd). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Contributors](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/graphs/contributors) tells you where we are,
  * [Our project roadmap](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/projects/1)
  * [Issues](https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio/issues)
  * [Chat](irc://chat.freenode.net/opengovernment). tbd

## Testing

  * For the backend code we test using Jupiter and sometimes using SpringBootTest or WireMock. Use of AssertJ is encouraged.
  * The frontend is tested using Jest.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

  * Always write a clear log message for your commits.
  * Please include the ticket id in commit messages, if possible.
  * Make sure that your contribution is well tested.
  * Try not to introduce new dependencies for common tasks

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We think that the Zen Of Python is a good idea and we hate code generation.
  * In Java we indent using four spaces (Intellij default settings)
  * In React we indent using two spaces using prettier.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. 

Thanks,
the dedica team
