# Nivio Demo

This folder contains sources to construct a demo landscape for [https://github.com/dedica-team/nivio]

## Quick Start

Just run 

    DEMO=1 docker-compose up

and then head to http://localhost:8080

## Custom Input

### Setup

1) Install curl or Postman or a similar tool to launch http requests. All examples are using curl.
2) Install docker-compose (or java) and run nivio or use the instance running at heroku. All examples here will target a local 
instance at port 8080 and assume docker is used.
3) *Optional*: Run a local webserver to simulate source pulling and state providers. The examples expect 
a server running on port 3000. Please notice that heroku will not work with locally hosted files, you can
use the raw sources from github instead.

You can try one of these:

    docker-compose up
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
    php -S 127.0.0.1:3000
    ruby -run -ehttpd . -p3000

### Running the Demo manually with specific files

* First create a landscape:


    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data-binary @sources/demo.yml http://localhost:8080/landscape
    
* Try sending any of the other files in any order.

    
    curl -X POST -H "Format: docker-compose" -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data @sources/docker-compose.yml http://localhost:8080/landscape/nivio:demo/services
